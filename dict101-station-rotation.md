## Python Dictionaries 101: Station Rotation

### Station 1: Understanding the Differences Between Dictionaries and Lists

## Objective
Learn how dictionaries and lists are set up and used differently.

## Instructions
1. Read the handout about the basic differences between lists and dictionaries.
2. Complete the matching exercise where you match definitions or use cases to either lists or dictionaries.
3. Check your answers against the teacher's answer key.

### Station 2: Creating and Adding Key-Value Pairs to a Dictionary

## Objective
Learn how to create an empty dictionary and then add key-value pairs to it.

## Instructions
1. Open your `main.py` script in VS Code.
2. Write code below to create an empty dictionary:
   ```python
   my_dict = {}
   ```
3. Add at least three key-value pairs to the dictionary. For example:
   ```python
   my_dict['name'] = 'Alyssa'
   my_dict['age'] = 25
   my_dict['city'] = 'Bellaire'
   ```
4. Print the dictionary to see the result:
   ```python
   print(my_dict)
   ```
5. Share your code with a partner and discuss what you learned specifically about dictionary **keys**.

### Station 3: Updating Key-Value Pairs in a Dictionary

## Objective
Learn how to update existing key-value pairs in a dictionary.

## Instructions
1. Reopen your `main.py` file in VS Code.
2. Start with the following predefined dictionary:
   ```python
   my_dict = {'name': 'Alyssa', 'age': 25}
   ```
3. Update the value of one of the keys. For example, change 'age' to 26:
   ```python
   my_dict['age'] = 26
   ```
4. Print the updated dictionary to verify the changes:
   ```python
   print(my_dict)
   ```
5. Challenge yourself to add one more new key-value pair and then print the final version of the dictionary.

### Station 4: Practical Application

## Objective
Apply what you've learned today about dictionaries by creating a simple dictionary of contacts and their phone numbers.

## Instructions
1. In VS Code, create a new Python file named `contacts.py`.
2. Create a dictionary to store contact names as keys and phone numbers as values.
3. Add at least five contacts to the dictionary. For example:
   ```python
   contacts = {
       'Alyssa': '231-774-2901',
       'Bianca': '987-654-3210',
       'Carlos': '555-287-6301',
       'David': '402-625-4474',
       'Elena': '614-147-3738'
   }
   ```
4. Then update the phone number for ONE contact. For example:
   ```python
   contacts['Alyssa'] = '570-514-2257'
   ```
5. Print the final version of the dictionary so you can see all its entries.
   
6. Think of one other feature or upgrade you could add to your contact book.  What would it be?  Tell your teacher about this feature/upgrade.
