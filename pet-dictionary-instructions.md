## Python List & Dictionary Comparison

### Objective

To understand how accessing items in a Python list is different from accessing key-value pairs in a Python dictionary

### List Instructions

- Create a Python list named `my_pet`
- Add the pet's **name**, **color**, and **type** (hamster, dog, cat, rabbit, etc.) as items to the list
- Then print a sentence about the pet that uses all the items contained in the list

### Dictionary Instructions

- Create a dictionary named `other_pet` (for a friend's pet)
- Add as key-value pairs the **name**, **color**, and **type** of pet your friend has to the `other_pet` dictionary
- Then use the dictionary keys to print the **name**, **color**, and **type** of the pet your friend has
